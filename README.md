# Assignment-1 : Woon Vin Hee

For my Assignment 1, the product I decided to choose is Cookie Run : Kingdom. It is a gacha game where players can build their cookies to go against other players or go through the main storyline. Not only that, players are also able to challenge themselves through other game modes like "Arena" and even more different game modes which are explained in the gameplay page!
